    Homework 7 / Final Project
    ALIGN Quest
    Old-School Adventure game to gain more experience with Classes,
    Objects, Files, Lists, Program Decomposition, and almost
    everything else we touched on in the course

    This file contains the starter code for the game's Rooms, Puzzles and
    Monsters. Left to:do for the student: Build out the Item class.
    The rest of the framework can be extended, but works as-is
'''

'''
    class: Room
    Description:
    This class encapsulates all of the behavior for the "areas" in our
    virtual world. A room is a general idea; rooms might be anywhere
    the player can explore by stepping into them (e.g. closets, boxes)
    Each room has a description and can contain items. Some rooms
    may have a puzzle to solve or a "monster" (our monsters are cute,
    furry animals or toys) that protect the room. If a monster or puzzle
    is present, the user must "deactivate" said puzzle/monster before
    the full room description is presented to them

    def __init__(self, number = 0, name = 'n/a',
                 description = 'trapped!', adjacent = [], picture = ''):

'''
    class: Item
    Description:
    This class encapsulates all of the behavior for the "things" in our
    rooms. Items can be collected by the player by Taking them during
    their quest. Items also have a description that players can see when
    they Look at the item. Players can also Drop or Use items
    For this prototype, puzzles and monsters CAN be attached to items
    (just like rooms) but the framework doesn't fully support the
    resolution of solutions for those puzzles on objects yet.
    reverse_effects() is future work, so you can leave it as a "pass"
    in your code

    class: Puzzle
    Description:
    This class encapsulates all of the behavior for the challenges in our
    rooms. Puzzle is a general term...right now it's not some hard problem
    to solve, but currently the use of some ITEM to "neutralize" the problem
    or monster the player encounters. E.g. a glass of water might neutralize
    a FIRE puzzle
    If puzzles are active, they occlude the regular description of a room
    Items neutralize puzzles and deactivate them

    This class is a subtype of Puzzle that can "attack" the user.
    All of our monsters are soft and furry creatures so they can't

    Like their superclass, they occlude the regular room description
    until they are neutralized
